A pipe is calculated different than an airplane wing etc.\nSome fluid dynamicists would tell you that it's an exact science. I personally feel that it's a bit subjective. \nThe most difficult parameter to nail down in my humble opinion is the characteristic length.\nIt's pretty easy for pipes, you just measure the diameter... but wings, plates, vortices...get complicated quickly.\n\n\nYou'll notice in the video I refrained from saying anything like \n\"Flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than XXX\" or \n\"Flow is turbulent when Reynolds number is more than XXX\".\nThere are different schools of thought on this.  Typically the transition between laminar flow and turbulent flow occurs somewhere between 2100 and 4000 (Reynolds number is unitless).\n\nLaminar Flow:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow\n\nReynolds Number:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number\n\nOsborne Reynolds\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Reynolds\n\nFeeling froggy?

Ultimately I decided it was ok to live with dye dripping out of the front.\n\nWe had to premix the dyes and eventually we got there.\n\nIt got to the point where we didn’t even really know what success looked like and always thought we were there.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe thought is my efforts making videos will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for my kids college education.

I think the most important technical issue to overcome is timing.  Much like how your brain can understand hearing someone's voice AFTER seeing their lips move, but not the opposite... the lag time of the sense of touch is an important thing for your brain.  Another thing I hand't considered is the \"rise time\" that has to do with internal stresses in your fingers.  If you conceptualize your fingers as water balloons around bones, you can understand how the internal pressure of your fingers rise the harder you press something.  This type of information coupled with the \"Sensory Homunculus\" make for some incredibly fulfilling thought experiments.  \n\nThe temperature question is something I'm particularly interested in.  Using a colder fluid to model a room temperature fluid because of the heat transfer equation is a fascinating area of scientific problem solving.  If you think it through, everything about this boils down to differential equations.  How much heat is leaking out of the hand, and at what rate, through what contact area?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nSensory / Cortical Homunculus \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus\n\nTwo Point Threshold\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_discrimination\n\nI asked HaptX for a blurb to explain their company.

A major mission of Hudson Alpha is to educate the public and promote genomics literacy.  I talked to many scientists about Genotyping but Dr. Lamb's ability to break down the complexity of the human genome is what finally brought it home for me.  Hudson Alpha provides many opportunities for Genomics Education and \n Hudson Alpha is http://hudsonalpha.org/ for explaining the difference between Genotyping and Sequencing.  To contact a super smart Genomics Professional at Hudson Alpha click here: hudsonalpha.org/contact \n\nGenotyping and Sequencing are very different:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing#DNA_sequencing\n\nThe 23andMe Genotyping service is provided by LabCorp\nAccording to their website, LabCorp is \"The World's Leading Health Care Diagnostics Company\"\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/\n\nNo Private or Health Information about any individual was recorded or shared in the making of this video (This video is HIPAA compliant).\n\nA special thanks to the Lab Manager Amanda Douglas for being a complete science rock star and a great person to work with  I spoke with about a dozen LabCorp Employees who are under Amanda and every one said she was an absolute joy to work for.  I know my experience working with her great and I hope her boss reads this blurb I wrote down here in the video description and gives her a high five and a big fat bonus or something equally as awesome.\n\n23andMe provide Genotyping testing using an Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 format chip.  Here's a bit about the chip.  Heads up, it's incredible technology. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVG04dAAyvY\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet Ideas to me at:\nhttp://twitter.com/smartereveryday\n\nI'm \"ilikerockets\" on Snapchat.\nSnap Code: http://i.imgur.com/7DGfEpR.png\n\nSmarter Every Day on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\n\nSmarter Every Day on Patreon\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nSmarter Every Day On Instagram\nhttp://www.instagram.com/smartereveryday\n\nSmarter Every Day SubReddit\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/smartereveryday\n\nAmbiance and musicy things by: Gordon McGladdery did the outro music  the video.  \nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/\nThe thought is it my efforts making videos will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for my kids college education.

Why haven't we figured this out before?  Whenever I go to Africa and South America I always make sure to pack a ridiculous amount of batteries.  People always ask me for them because batteries which you purchase in country are horrible.  This blending of an ancient technology with a new technology is a game changer, and as a mechanical engineer, I find it to be super exciting.  \n\nFor those wondering, the units are just under $10, so the payback for a family in a developing nation should end up being about 3 months.  This effectively eliminates the kerosene lighting poverty trap that millions of people fall into.  I absolutely love it when engineering innovation solves an economic and environmental issue.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please SHARE THE VIDEO!\n\nIf you REALLY liked it, feel free to pitch in via Patreon:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nDestin\n\n\nPsalm 111:2",

Animating anything for 10 minutes is a big deal so instead of trial and error, he put what he knew about the rules of perspective and made this grid system to line things up, all to make the dots on that map in the corner work like you'd expect them to.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

For those of you who might be skeptical, great!  The good news is that right circularly prismatic kiddie pools are only $10 and you can do the experiment for yourself at your latitude.  There's really no reason you shouldn't do this on your own, so before you criticize how we've done it, I'd strongly encourage you to do it for yourself.\n\nSmarter Every Day Instagram: http://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nPatreon Support Link: http://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nwww.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\n\nVeritasium on Instagram: http://instagram.com/veritasium\nPatreon Support Link: http://www.patreon.com/veritasium\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/veritasium\nhttp://www.facebook.com/veritasium\n\nGordon McGladdery did all of the sound design for the video.  We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one.  There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example.  It's really neat.\n\nThe neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.\n\nThanks to Jacob Vehrs for helping make the plywood pool platform.\n\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\nThere was a study performed at MIT years ago (http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf/09VOR.pdf) that explained the physics involved.  We repeated some of these demonstrations, but on opposite sides of the globe…and in a way that can be easily understood.\nThis site is a great resource on the Coriolis effect and ways people have gotten it wrong:\nhttp://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html\n\nThe Coriolis Effect influences the flight of a bullet.\nhttp://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap11/artillery.html\n\nWe would love for someone to replicate this demonstration.  Please tweet your results to us @SmarterEveryDay and @Veritasium.\nHere's the link to puchase the exact same pool:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Intex-56451NP-Inflatable-Snapset-Pool/dp/B000OV0X34/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1433743067&sr=1-1&keywords=5%27+kiddie+pool\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for the kids' education. Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please SHARE THE VIDEO!\n\nIf you REALLY liked it, feel free to pitch a few dollars towards their college fund by clicking here:\nhttp://bit.ly/KidsCollege\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nDestin",

Couldn't have done it without Bob!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\nA quick clarification....\nIt took me 8 months to learn how to do this, but I was only picking up the bike and running to the end of the driveway and back every day.  I wasn't \"ACTIVELY\" trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.\n\nDo not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.  That's simply not true.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTweet ideas to me\nhttps://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nI'm also on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit\nhttp://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/smartereveryday\n\nIf you like what I do and want to support my efforts to create Smart kids and Smarter Every Day here are a couple of links you can use to help.

I should note, that Byron doesn't call himself the \"Best\" archer, or the \"Most Amazing\" archer or anything like that.  These are my words, because to me, he really is the most amazing archer.\nHe's a cool dude with the right balance of humility and confidence, and I have an incredible amount of respect for him as a person.  I'm under no obligation to recommend that you hire him for your live event... but I do.

It was a new geometric concept to me that I had never used and really liked the idea of exploring it.

          "title": "HOW TO PICK A COLOGNE - Scentual Science - Smarter Every Day 125",
          "description": "My beautiful wife is forever patient with me.  Ask her the results: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride \nTweet→http://bit.ly/CologneTwT   Post to FB→http://bit.ly/CologneFB\nhttp://www.harrys.com Promo Code: \"SMARTER\"\n⇊⇊ Click below for more info ⇊⇊\n\nIf you'd like to ask my wife what she thought about this experiment feel free to tweet her: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride\n\nIf you did what I do, there's a cool way you can make it easier for me to do it:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWill Leahy compiled all the data.\nhttp://willleahy.info\nIf you want to play with the graph, it's here!\nhttp://willleahy.info/SEDcologne/\n\nOutro music by A Shell in the Pit\n\"Bottles\" which can be downloaded here.\nhttps://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/minke-bottles\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nMy first attempts with a new cologne would be to just apply it and wait for a comment.  We have busy lives so often she wouldn't say anything.  If one reached out and grabbed her attention (I try to apply only enough for her to smell me when she's close... not like a high school boy who pours it on) I knew it was an interesting scent to her.  I tried to be honest, so many times I would wear one an entire day without a single comment from her.  That was pretty hard to do because I was hungry for data.  Sometimes if the mood was right and we were getting ready or something I'd casually ask what she thought about a certain fragrance.  She's conducted serious biological research projects before so she understood all along the importance of the data set.\n\nSome colognes I only tried once because it was obvious one of us hated it.  Others were kind of in the \"whatever\" region.  Those I would often try multiple times.  Some she really liked one day, but not another.  Those took multiple tries to weed out.  \n\nOften I would go without wearing anything, or perhaps my old aftershave just to make sure she wasn't gaming the system.  The first or second day or so I realized that if she knew the names of the colognes it DRASTICALLY influenced her opinions.  That just goes to show you how powerful marketing is on our perceptions. \n\nAt some points she got confused because she couldn't tell if I was re-wearing something I had tried earlier.  For example, she became a bit self conscious about whether or not she had already told me she liked one...   I could tell she was trying to give me consistent answers, but I kept shifting it up so much I filtered out all her attempts to game the data.  \n\nI also noticed that if I wore one that she complimented or mentioned without being prompted.\n\nIn the end, I'm really happy with what we chose.  It's light and a bit sweet, but still has swagger to it.  I fancy myself a manly man, and I think she likes that about me.  If you want to try to pull the answer out of her, I'm sure she would get a kick out of that. Tweet her at https://twitter.com/DestinsBride and see if you can talk her out of the answer.  If you're a normal supporter, PM me on Patreon and I'll tell you the result.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is the Facebook Survey I pulled the data from:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay/posts/808737802493720\n\nTweet ideas to me\nhttps://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nI'm also on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit\nhttp://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/smartereveryday\n\nIf you like what I do and want to support my efforts to create Smart kids and Smarter Every Day here are a couple of links you can use to help.

Tenured Mechanical Engineering professor at UAH\n\nUAH Director of Hockey Operations Nick Laurila\n\nThe nameless UAH Hockey player \n\nGo Chargers!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nThe stick rigidity data collected by Dr. Evans and I is not a formal reflection on the manufacturers because the sticks were previously used and we could not find an ASTM standard to setup our test. The possibility exists that I put the support positions too close together, which would make the values lower.  The players however gave us the sticks because they were \"so used they were now flimsy\".  Our data reflected this.  If I had it to do over again I would test a new stick vs an old stick.  Kettering University has done some research on this subject and we tried to setup our test apparatus similar to theirs.  They applied the force to the foot of the stick.  We applied the force to the center. http://www.kettering.edu/news/taking-stick-check\n\nI thought this was a great video of a product that has normalized the process by constraining the 1 inch deflection measurement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2f7SQgn-9I\n\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSUPPORT\n\nThis episode graciously supported by several people via Subbable and Patreon.

It's quite funny, but deep down I'm jealous of how clever it is.\n\nRobert Farrell answered my Facebook appeal for Photographers/Videographers in the Milwaukee Wisconsin area and filmed the skaters at the Pettit National ice Center for me.\nHe's a photographer http://www.robertfarrellphotography.com/ \n\n-------------------------------\nWith thanks to:\n\nJR Ginex-Orinion - he helped me by putting the equation in LaTex and giving me a file.  This saved me a lot of time and I'm grateful.\n\nKevin Butler at the Pettit National Ice Center in Wisconsin was helpful in coordinating the filming of the speed skaters.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nIf you want to learn this in detail stop what you're doing and read the three pages around \"Equation 5\" in this book.  I was particularly interested in the \"warm ice\" vs \"cold ice\" issues.\nhttp://bit.ly/1jRa32X\n\nThis is also a great article about why ice is slippery:\nhttp://lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/trizac/Ens/L3FIP/Ice.pdf\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

His content is very intelligent and he consistently puts out clever, unique, and interesting content so I decided to contact him and see if he was willing meet up.  I'd love to see him be successful.\n\nAll slow motion sound design and Audio Engineering was done by Gordon McGladdery of \"A Shell In the Pit\".  He designed all the slow motion lip warble sounds from scratch.  http://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/  \n\nI shot Flula's lips at 1,500 Frames per second with a Phantom MIRO LC320S made by Vision Research:\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/Phantom-Miro-M320S\n\nThe sine wave and square wave graphic was designed by Will Leahy\nHe has a website, but there's nothing there: http://www.willleahy.info/  He's working on it.\n\nThe technical sound data was fact checked by:  I said some things wrong initially.  I confused \"Additive Synthesis\" and Filtering.  Gordon McGladdery and these guys got me back on track.  \nGary Bourgeois http://www.chromaxen.com/garymc/\nTimothy McGuinness - http://www.timothymcguinness.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\"Timbre\" is basically the wastebasket that Audio Engineers throw all the stuff that they don't really know how to categorize into anything else.  It's the \"color\" of the sound.  Take a minute and read about it:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre\n\nSpectrograms are created by a math operation known as a Fourier Transform. If you don't know what a FFT is, you really should.  Read a bit about shifting stuff from the time to the frequency domain.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou know Gordon's music by now.  It's all good.\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

Check his stuff out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eilw4-NNlEw\nDid I mention HE LET ME PUNCH HIM AS HARD AS I COULD?\n\nMusic \"A little discomfort, a whole lot of Freedom\", and  \"Piano Improvisation\" by A Shell In The Pit.  \nYou know Gordon's music by now.  It's all good.\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/\n\nI shot the punch with a Phantom MIRO LC320S made by Vision Research:\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/Phantom-Miro-M320S/\n\nWith thanks to Houdini Historian \nJohn Cox, who provided the drawing at 1:07\nFor more information about Houdini visit John's blog\n\"Wild about Harry\"\nhttp://www.wildabouthoudini.com\n\nA big thank you to Ben Eells who responded to my call for help on Facebook and spent both a Saturday and a Sunday to shoot footage of Houdini's grave for us.  He originally went on Saturday but the graveyard was closed for the Sabbath.  I didn't know that!

Instead, it only partially surrounds it, likely enabling better airflow to control for humidity and may help prevent fungi from growing on, and eventually killing, the pupa. This cocoon very likely belongs to a moth in the family Urodidae, which is known for making this type of lattice-structured cocoon surrounding its pupa.\n\nCheck out some more technical reading:\nPapers on a similar caterpillars: \nhttp://bit.ly/11B076F\nhttp://www.troplep.org/TLR/5-2/pdf007...\nhttp://pubs.ext.vt.edu/444/444-007/44...\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThanks to Rainforest Expeditions for inviting me down, if you'd like to go down to the Amazon Rainforest and see all of this for yourself check them out at http://www.perunature.com\nPhil Torres is the Conservation Biologist in the video who was wise enough to bring his books to the middle of the jungle!

          "description": "\"Goggle Up!  Science is about to happen...Share by Tweet: http://bit.ly/YAsk8M  Facebook: http://bit.ly/PrinceRupert\nREAD THE ADDITIONAL INFO HERE! (Click \"Show More\"!)\nPlease help me justify putting this much time and effort into a video by clicking \"LIKE\" and SHARING this as much as possible. Click the following: Tweet: http://bit.ly/TweetRupert    Facebook: http://bit.ly/PrinceRupert  Please share with any science blogs or outlets you think would enjoy it.  \n\nVideos like this don't just happen.  They require lots of time, and lots of favors from very smart and kind people willing to help me and you learn.  PLEASE take a moment and read the following information and support those who supported me.\n\nThis is the camera we used for the ultra-high speed shots.  It has the \"FAST\" option.\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/v16102/\n\nYou absolutely have to check out the stuff Cal Makes.  We're just goofing off in this video, but the guy is some type of glass wizard genius.  It would make me happy if you bought something from him and he felt like the audience appreciated all the time he donated to this video. He basically gave me 2 entire nights of his entire shop.\nhttp://orbixhotglass.com/\nI feel like we're friends at this point, and he is open to the idea of doing more videos in the future and teach me more about what he knows about glass.  Let's make it worth his time.\n\nI'm a HUGE FAN of the song Gordon wrote for this video.  His landlord would really appreciated if you downloaded it so he could make rent this month.\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/manta\nIt looks like he's assembling a new album that I may like more than Mammals:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/album/hydrophile-in-progress\nShow him some love.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis video involved about 2 months of research, and me reaching out to several individuals.  I would like to thank everyone who took time out of their schedule to contribute to my wacky research.  A big thanks to the following people:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMy wife and kids.  I'm sorry this took so long and I wasn't the kind of active father I want to be during the 5 weeks it took to make this.\n\nDr. Martyn Poliakoff for getting me access to documents which details experiments on the Prince Rupert's Drop by the Royal Society \nhttp://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/41/1/1.full.pdf+html  (behind a pay wall)\n\nBeing able to calculate the failure front velocity of a Prince Rupert's drop is a pretty big deal.  For years this was a scientific mystery.  High speed camera technology is only recently fast enough to provide data like this.  Thanks to Vision Research for letting me use the V1610 to try to unravel this mystery for the public in general. \n\nRob Kuefner for reaching out to me and offering to convert certain equations into LaTeX format for me.\n\nDr. Jeff Evans from UAH.  A friend and neighbor who just happens to have a PhD and be an expert in fracture mechanics. http://bit.ly/YLezDA Thank you for helping me by pointing me in the right direction in the early stages of my research.  It's time we hangout again.\n\nBrian: thanks for letting me use your green screen and telling me about Orbix in the first place.  I stayed up there til about 1 or 2 am two nights in a row acting stupid in front of of the camera all alone.  Now that I look back at that footage without the context of this video, it's all very strange.\n\nThanks to Loïc Samuel for taking time to make the custom TNT Degradation graphic!\n\nP.S. There was some old guy walking around the track at the park when I was filming me jumping on the bridge railing.  I'm pretty sure you kept walking until I was done just to make sure you wouldn't have to take me to the hospital if I broke my leg.  I'll never meet you again, but I'm grateful for this kind gesture you didn't know I noticed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterYouTube\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education. Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please SHARE THE VIDEO!\n\nIf you REALLY liked it, feel free to pitch a few dollars towards their college fund by clicking here:\nhttp://bit.ly/KidsCollege\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nDestin",

          "description": "This is a REAL PLACE... and this happens EVERY MORNING!! I went there two mornings and made observations.  It was amazing.  \nPlease Click to Tweet! http://bit.ly/MACAWesomeSLOWMO \nI apologize for the video being a couple of minutes longer... but it took months of planning and preparation to do this.  I wanted to leave a bit in there about the boat so I wouldn't lose the memories! The noise was awful though (Macaws have a horrible song).\n\nI didn't know most of the rain in the Amazon comes from the Atlantic!\nSo this is what happens when you combine a battery operated Miro LC320S high speed camera with an incredibly specific spot of dirt that Macaws LOVE.  It took several days and lots of modes of transportation to get there, but  we took a new MIRO (http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/Phantom-Miro-M320S/) to one of the most remote research facilities in the Peruvian Rainforest.  The footage we obtained was incredible.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHow to get there yourself!:\nI coordinated the travel with Rainforest Expeditions \nhttp://www.perunature.com/\nTell them Destin sent you.\nYou can checkout what they do on their Facebook page: www.facebook.com/Rainforest.Expeditions\nThey ran me up and down the river in a boat, gave me lenses, a clean bed, awesome food etc.  It was pretty amazing!\nSee the research project's website here:\nhttp://macawproject.org/index.php\n\nThe project is led by Dr. Don Brightsmith\nSchubot Exotic Bird Health Center\nDepartment of Veterinary Pathobiology\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine\n\nJeff Cremer was my hook-up for all things photography once I got on site.  He's very good at technical photography and is more than capable of handling anything you can throw at him.  Check out his chops and tell him Destin sent you:\nhttp://bit.ly/JeffPhoto\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nArtist Info:\nSarah Xu, a student at the Vancouver Film School made the awesome introduction Drawing. http://captainpillow.blogspot.ca/ \n\nGordon, the guy in charge of \"Scary Parrot Monsters\" at the end of the video wrote this song.  It's called \"Black Rhino\"... and is available for download online:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/album/mammals\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

Please consider sharing by clicking here: http://bit.ly/FLIPPIN_CATS  GiGi was not hurt during the making of this video.  We took great care to make sure she would be safe. Next I'll explain how the physics involved in flipping cats allow us to operate Space Telescopes (Seriously).\nSo as simple of a question as this is, it turns out to be a MAJOR POINT OF STUDY in Physics, Robotics, Space Satellite Control, Weapons Development, Biomedical Engineering, etc.  It's stumped scientists and engineers since Newton's day.  Here's something interesting.  The cat isn't twisting his back.. he's actually BENDING it.  The next video will go into great detail about what's going on there, and explain how it relates to studying the farthest points in the universe (Seriously... the fact that a cat can do this allows us to study the Universe.. no exaggeration).\n\nThe high speed camera used was a Phantom Miro M320S.

I never thought about how little bugs handle events that greatly disturb their immediate surroundings.  They're low mass, therefore they are influenced by their environment WAY more than we are. Also, just think about the processing power that is in the Fly's brain!  And such a small package too!\n\nClick here to see playlist: http://bit.ly/Men2vR\n\nThe high speed camera used was a Phantom V10.  Rent one yourself by clicking here: http://bit.ly/wQPlHd \n\nLink to the song \"Armadillo\" by A Shell in the Pit: http://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/armadillo\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn this video, I mention that the fly uses his center of gravity to realign himself. The high speed video must be analyzed further to determine if he was rotating over faster than acceleration due to gravity.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTweet me now: http://bit.ly/TweetDestin\n\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/SED-Facebook\n\nI make videos to raise money for my kids' college education. I have 3 kids and plan on spending the next 10 years contributing to the public body of knowledge and helping you learn!

Your heart's plumbing SIGNIFICANTLY changed with your first breath.  AWESOME huh?\nHave you ever heard of someone \"with a hole in their heart\".  The Foramen Ovale doesn't seal completely causing improper flow.\n\nHere's the verse at the end of the video: http://bit.ly/xSFYDM\n\nMany people seem to be having a problem with Doc's explanation.  I would remind you that he's a Doctor and is qualified to make these statements.  We made that cut several times, and I asked him to simplify his summary very greatly.  When doing so he didn't include descriptions of meconium, pulmonary pressure differentials, etc.  These were discussed in detail, but I chose to leave them out and only focus on the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosis.   We also used the term \"breathe\" loosely when the baby is inside the womb because there isn't an oxygen exchange in the baby's lungs with amniotic fluid.  \n\nBabies do \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" amniotic fluid:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid#Functions_of_amniotic_fluid\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-88-470-1402-2_5?LI=true\n\nBabies do defecate in the womb:\nhttp://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(02)71437-3/abstract\n\nA special thanks to Wayne for filming the scene with Dr. Schuster and operating camera focus on the scene with engineering paper.\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

          "description": "What is your plan to help educate the future generation appreciate Science, Technology, Engineering and Math? -Post this to Facebook by clicking here:  http://on.fb.me/OperationRocket\nWatch the girls on the far right at 2:10.  They had no idea what a rocket was. Happy Principal at 2:42 on the far left.\nThe Gambia is the smallest country on the African Mainland.  We went to a basic school and \"performed an experiment\" to measure the winds up in the sky.  The teachers, children, and the principal loved it.\n\nThe location of the school was deep into the heart of The Gambia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farafenni\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~MUSIC!~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe custom music was created by \"A Shell In The Pit\".\nThe song used is \"Rockets\" by \"A Shell In The Pit\".  Download it here:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/rockets\n\n\nStevo was living in The Gambia while he served in the US Peace Corps.  No laws were broken to get the Rockets to the School.  I mailed them months in advance LEGALLY. They were in a book because the Gambian postal workers have a nasty habit of stealing things they want. Books are pretty good camouflage! \n\nWe couldn't motivate kids to come out and watch, so we shot the first rocket for a small group of kids.  After hearing the rocket and all their friends screaming and laughing they came running.  The principal then instructed me to give an impromptu lesson on what rockets are, and why they are used to the whole school.  While I gave the lesson, Stevo taught all the teachers how to reload and fire the rockets.  In all, we did three shots and left the materials with the teachers for another day.  The science teacher in particular was so excited he couldn't stop thanking us.  He said getting the kids motivated about science education was difficult for him because of how many real world hardships the kids had.  The Rockets being launched at the school was the talk of the town for several days.  Kids who didn't show up to school that day were sad they had skipped.  Many more showed up after that, which was part of the goal.... to get people excited about education in general.\n\nHere is another video of someone else teaching well recieved STEM materials in The Gambia.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwsHbbTOpwA\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

Click This:  http://on.fb.me/POOPSPLASH \nI'm being told OB/GYN Doctors are playing this video on their iPads to help describe why some patients have problems with reoccurring UTIs.\nI was reading a pretty intense paper on Worthington Jets and thought about how awesome it would be to create a video with a Fecal Simulant to relate this scientific phenomenon to every man's problems.  I find Worthington jets fascinating.  They are very similar to what's happinging during the Munroe Effect.  \n\nThe Camera used is a Vision Research Phantom.  Their website is here:\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/\n\nThe music was created by \"A Shell In The Pit\".  Download the song here:  Support the artist:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/07-grizzly-tattoo)\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

          "description": "Post to FB: http://on.fb.me/H2OGuns \n\nCome on, we've all wondered this.  There's been dozens of videos and discussions on the internet about it, but what actually happens?\n\nI'm shooting with a high speed camera made by Vision Research.  \nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/Contact-Us/Contact-Form/  -  Click here and tell them Destin sent you!  That will be fun.\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/  -  Click for high speed video awesomeness\n\nAWESOME MUSIC INFO:\n\"Rep By Pop\" Written and recorded by James Cleary and A Shell in the Pit with bass by Neil Towers.   You can get the song here:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/02-rep-by-pop\n\nSeveral before/after experiments have been performed, but they all have one flaw. It's extremely difficult to visualize what is going on with the flow-fields of the weapon blasts during the time of firing.\n\nWe planned and assembled several different assets including a high speed camera over a few months and then ran a test designed specifically to allow the viewer to observe the gas dynamics in great detail!\n\nNeedless to say, this was a blast.  Well, two blasts if you want to be technical about it (and we usually do).\n\n\nI performed an experiment to see what the differences were between semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.  The advantage of shooting under water is that you can see the boundary of the gas flow fields almost perfectly.\n\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

We designed, built, and ran this fire-based Rube Goldberg in 36 hours.  \n\nSorry to dissapoint, it's just an air tank.  Fire extinguishers were EVERYWHERE just in case.  I'll show more in the setup videos, which are uploading now.  \n\nThe sequence of events is as follows:\nRemote Control Vacuum cleaner is turned on\nFire tornado increases vorticity, thus raises in height\nCannon fuse is lit by fire tornado\nFuze breaks link holding up hammer\nHammer falls, pulling string\nString pull trigger on Rifle\nRifle fires bullet across table and strikes matches\nMatches light and ignite another fuze\nFuze lights gunpowder transfer tray\nGunpowder lights rocket\nRocket lights gasoline\nGasoline ignites 2 rockets and 2 Roman Candles\nRockets ignite Bonfire and fireworks\n\nA buddy of mine from Canada did the music.  He's pretty sharp with the tunes and can crank out customized songs pretty quickly.  If you're interested here's how to get in touch with him:\n\nMusic written and recorded by A Shell in the Pit-- \nhttp://ashelllinthepit.com\nCommission music for your project (or ask questions, chat, etc.) here-- http://ashellinthepit.com/contact.htm.\nBuy music (for non-commercial use) here--\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

I became instantly fascinated and commissioned her to make me a bolt of cloth.  I asked for the brightest colors possible like a rainbow (for my daughter) and asked for permission to video her work.  She worked for about a day and a half.  I filmed this in the afternoon of the first day.  If you look closely at the end of the video you can almost see the pride in her eyes that I'm taking such interest in her craft.\r\n\r\nNotice the child with an umbilical hernia in the background.\r\n\r\n\r\nA buddy of mine from Canada did the music.  He's pretty sharp with the tunes and can crank out customized songs pretty quickly.  I emailed him some sounds from my trip to Africa and he made the intro song out of them.  If you're interested here's how to get in touch with him:\r\n\r\nMusic written and recorded by A Shell in the Pit-- \r\nhttp://ashelllinthepit.com\r\nCommission music for your project (or ask questions, chat, etc.) here-- http://ashellinthepit.com/contact.htm.\r\nBuy music (for non-commercial use) here--\r\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com",

For some reason all these years I thought pineapples grew on trees, I just never thought it through.  I felt pretty stupid once I thought about it.  I'm just posting this as a \"you probably already knew this, but just in case you didn't\".",

          "description": "Chris Fussell was stopped by police in Baltimore for taking photos of a train, a major hobby of his.  Chris wasn't like most of us.  He had taken time to educate himself on the law and his rights.  Its not a good idea to ever contradict a police officer unless you're 100% sure it's safe, and the officer is acting illegally.  Chris's incident seems quite the opposite of an interaction I had with the police in Tuscaloosa immediately after the Tornadoes.  The police force in Tuscaloosa went out of their way to make the public aware of their rights, and how to feel comfortable at night without any power. \n\nWe're not gun crazy people down here in Alabama.  We view guns as a tool, much like a camera or a vehicle.  These particular police men had run a suspected looter off from my sister's house the night before.  This is a great example of a government of \"we the people\" working for the people.  As much heat as policemen get these days on the internet, I thought it would be a great idea to give credit to these fine men serving us in harms way every day. \n\nThe Saiga 12 is a little difficult to load with the bolt forward.  Here, an officer shows me the right way to do it before going back out on patrol.",

          "description": "I thought I would upload some footage to let you know what it was like just after the Tornado hit.  We called it the \"zombie apocalypse\".  I had many very very interesting experiences during this time.  All of the 3 cities I have lived in over the last 10 years were affected in a major way.  My immediate and extended family were spared, experiencing only inconvenience.  The question is often asked, \"why would a good God allow such things to happen?\"  As a Christian, the honest answer is \"I don't know\".  I can however, report on how it changed us.  We met and became very close to very many people we otherwise wouldn't have known.  We were knocked off our high horse and forced to accept the generosity of others in thankful humility.  I feel like this disaster has made me, personally a different person, (and one might argue for the better).  \r\n\r\nTo say \"God didn't allow this\" is a cop-out.  He's either all knowing and all powerful, or he isn't.  I happen to personally believe he is both, and every life affected was changed in a very specific way.  I, like many others, began to focus on things other than myself and my own personal desires.  I began to try more earnestly to understand Jesus's teachings about how I'm to interact with others.\r\n\r\nWe feel really blessed to still have Briley after this.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  This is probably the only video about the tornado that I'll describe my beliefs on.  You will now return to your normally scheduled \"Smarter Every Day\".",

          "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterEveryDay\n\nSMARTER EVERY DAY - 1st episode.  More filmed already. Please Subscribe\nI think this is going to be big...\n\nThe Saiga 12 is basically an 12 guage in an AK-47 form factor.\nUsually when people see a fireball they are quick to call it an explosion or a detonation.  In actuality, what they've witnessed is a type of explosion called a \"Deflagration\". Many things are deflagrations.  Logs burning in a fireplace are Deflagrating.  The primer inside the shotgun is actually detonating.  Lead Styphenate or Mercury Fulmanide are used in cartridge primers to start the pyrotechnic train in a bullet/shell.  The primer itself is detonating, which kicks off the gunpowder which burns in the shell.  Any powder detonations occur in the chamber.  As the powder burns and begins to push the projectile out (gas seals with the barrel with something called an \"obteration seal\").  The powder in the barrel is also deflagrating.",

This water was running from a spring type source and falling into a pool.  It's not the Leidenfrost effect, but it looks just like it.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nFrom WBeaty:\r\n\r\nHere's an article ref about the droplets:\r\n\r\nC.L. Stong, \"Curious Bubbles in Which a Gas Encloses a Liquid Instead of the Other Way Around\", Scientific American Magazine, THE AMATEUR SCIENTIST, April 1974\r\n\r\nThe key to the effect is EXTREMELY CLEAN WATER. Usually we don't see the droplets, since any microscopic crap on the water surface will let the droplets \"pop\" and merge into the water surface. With clean water, they last a couple of seconds. With extremely clean water they'll last far longer. Also see:\r\n\r\nhttp://amasci.com/amateur/antibub/antibub1.html\r\nhttp://www.antibubble.org/page2.shtml\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",

          "description": "Aliasing occurs when your measurement frequency is not fast enough to accurately capture the measured event.  In general, you want your measurement device to be one order of magnitude faster than the event being measured.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: accessed January 9th 2011\r\n\"In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing refers to an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.\"",

Isn't she a good sport?  We had another rooster in a cage on the floor behind her, hence her 2 chicken comment.  My favorite part is when she lets me put the chicken on her head and acts as if everything is perfectly normal.  I'm trying to teach her the concept of \"performing  a test\".  She's getting is pretty well.  We're starting to test matchbox cars to see which is the fastest and things like that.  \n\nif you are interested in helping us via a microscholarship (very micro) contact me for more info.\n\nAlso, after seeing my \"design\" another user, Jeremiahjw was inspired to create his own chicken steadicam.

I shot the video about three months ago and just now edited it down.  \n\nThe micro camera website mentioned above has lots of examples of what this camera is an how to operate it.  You'd be pretty amazed how many uses there are for one.\n\nI hope you enjoy!  If you enjoy my stuff, I would appreciate it if you subscribe!  I've also posted another video which investigates the \"Backdriven reflex\" in more depth.  It can be viewed here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvPhBJpCeGg\n\nPeople are often worried about how tight the binder was on the chicken's head.  You'll note I said \"without hurting the chicken\".  I stretched the binder out so it had a very light clamping force.  \n\nAlso, this video inspired another user, Jeremiahjw to create his own chicken powered steadicam.  His video can be seen here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adlgpovEv7g&feature=email\n\nPennywhistle Productions.\n\n\nIf you enjoy Smarter Every Day and would like to help me come one step closer to sending the kids to college click here: http://bit.ly/MicroScholarship4MyKids",

          "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterYoutube\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh speed photography isn't quite as difficult as one might think.  It may be accomplished simply with a flash and a camera capable of holding open the shutter.  Most of these photos were taken in my garage with my rifle setup.  \r\n\r\nThe acoustic trigger circuit kit is available from http://www.hiviz.com/.  The kits are designed and distributed by Dr. Loren Winters, a high speed photography wizard who is truly a high speed photography pioneer who has given greatly of himself to introduce students to the wonders of Newtonian Physics.   \r\n\r\nCheckout my FLICKR high speed photoset if you're bored - http://www.flickr.com/photos/40994371@N07/sets/72157624817117165/\r\n\r\nThe music was created by \"A Shell in the Pit\".  Please support this wonderful artist by purchasing his music.  An example of his work can be found at: \r\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/cicadas-waltz\r\n\r\nLastly, I'm working on a website http://www.artisticballistics.com.  I'm trying to fund my children's education by selling awesome art created with bullets.  It will take me a few weeks to get the site up and running.  \r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions\r\nArtistic Ballistics\r\nA Shell In the Pit\r\nHiViz",

          "description": "https://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nI would appreciate it if you subscribed and click this-  http://on.fb.me/MatchWithBullet\n\nWe had a little fun while trying to light matches with a bullet.  Turns out, after we got all our fixturing dialed in, we were able to light multiple matches with a single bullet.  A phantom high speed camera helps tell the story.  Mythbusters only tried to light one match with a bullet, so we figured we might as well try to push the envelope.  I'm sure Jamie and Adam have the budget and time to figure out the perfect curve to stack arrange all the bullets in to light all matches.  They're good like that!  Heck, give us a little credit.  We're rednecks.  We're lucky we can even read.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

          "description": "Some of my happiest moments....\r\n\r\nI was going through some old files and found this old video I made of a mission trip I took to Peru.  The children were wonderful and very happy to have someone loving on them.  Love knows no language barriers.  My intent was simple, to show Love to others and tell them that they are free to read the Bible for themselves and interpret its message on their own.\r\n\r\nI loved and was loved.  The words of Jesus were lived out.  Feel free to ask any questions.\r\n\r\nI realize the video and editing quality is very low.  This was from back in the old days before I learned a thing or two about editing.  The irony is that this video will receive the lowest number of hits on my channel, but it's certainly the most important.  Whether you trust in Jesus or not, hopefully you can agree with me that Loving and serving others is a beautiful thing.  When we get over ourselves and live for others, only then will we truly live.\r\n\r\nThe song is \"Hands and Feet\" by Audio Adrenaline.  \r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

No, I'm not serious.\r\n2. The anesthesia didn't 'take' on the right toe because it was so infected.  Lack of bloodflow prevented the good stuff from getting to where it needed to go.\r\n3.

          "description": "Rainwater Observatory is a world class observatory located in the small town of French Camp, MS.  When I visited there I was shocked to find out they didn't have any type of promotional videos on the internet.  They believe science supports faith, just as I do.  The directors were kind enough to stay late and allow me to create a shoot this footage so I could make a short film for them.   There's lots of time lapse footage, as well as images taken from their Sangre telescope.  Call them to set up a tour!  We looked at the moon when I was there.\r\n\r\nIn my experience Faith supports science, and vice versa.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.rainwaterobservatory.org/\r\n\r\n\"The Heavens Declare the Glory of God\".\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

          "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterYoutube\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions\r\n\r\nMy sister covers \"Brand New key\" by Melanie Safka (from the 70s).  \r\n\r\nAll Music (guitar x 2, djembe, eggs, shotgun, vocals) was created by Briley in seperate video tracks then edited together.  My favorite part is the bicycle \"all around the world\" scene in the background.  It's a combination of stopmotion and green screen chroma keying.\r\n\r\nThe video was created with the use of a home-made green screen in my garage,  Stop Motion software called i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, Garage Band, an Ipod and a talented Sister.  \r\n\r\nShe plays Acoustic Guitar, Djembe, percussion eggs, and a Mossberg Shotgun.  \r\n\r\nMeine Schwester spielt eine Coverversion des Liedes \"Brand New Key\" von Melanie Safka (aus den 70er Jahren).\r\n\r\nDie gesamte Musik (2x Gitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier, Schrotflinte und Gesang) wurde von Briley in einzelnen Videos gespielt und dann zusammen geschnitten. Meine Lieblingsstelle ist die \"Mit-Fahrrad-durch-die-ganze-Welt\"-Szene im Hintergrund. Das ist eine Kombination von Stop-Motion- und Green-Screen-Aufnahmen im Chromakey-Verfahren.\r\n\r\nDas Video wurde erstellt mit der Benutzung eines selbstgebauten Green-Screens in meiner Garage, einer Stop-Motion-Software namens i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, einer Garagenband, einem Ipod und einer talentierten Schwester.\r\n\r\nSie spielt Akustikgitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier und eine Mossberg Schrotflinte.\r\n\r\nMa soeur reprend \"Brand New Key\" de Melanie Safka (des années 70).\r\n\r\nToute la partie musicale (guitare x2, djembe, oeufs, fusil, chant) a été enregistrée par Briley sur des pistes vidéo distinctes ensuite assemblées au montage. Mon passage favori est la scène de la bicylette \"partout dans le monde\" en arrière-plan. C'est une combinaison entre techniques de stop-motion et de chroma key fond vert.\r\n\r\nCette vidéo a été réalisée grâce à une toile verte maison tirée dans mon garage, aux logiciels i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express et Garage Band, un Ipod ainsi qu'à une soeur talentueuse.\r\n\r\nElle joue avec une guitare acoustique, un djembe, des oeufs percussion et un fusil Mossberg.\r\n\r\nFrench Translation courtesy of: PiPoCoeur \r\n\r\nLooking for translations of this description in all languages.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

Moderne bewegungs Prozessoren benutzen einen sogennanten Inertial Measurement Unit, eine art Inertialsensor. Diese Geräte geben Daten an so dass es möglich ist die Bewegnung auszugleichen. Hühner haben anscheinend das selbe Biomechanismus aber mit höhreren aktualisierungs Häufigkeit.\n*Update* Die Hühner wurden bei dem Familienhund gefressen! OOOPS \n\n*Update #2* Meine Schwester und Ich haben ein Musikvideo aufgenommen. Wenn es Sie interresiert suchen Sie \"Briley brand new key\"\n\n*Update #3*\nDieses Video wird in Japan auf Fuji-TV Spielen. Ha Ha. Wer hätte es gedacht?\n\n*Update #4* July 10th, 2009 Eine Million hits! Geil!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

A pipe is calculated different than an airplane wing etc.\nSome fluid dynamicists would tell you that it's an exact science. I personally feel that it's a bit subjective. \nThe most difficult parameter to nail down in my humble opinion is the characteristic length.\nIt's pretty easy for pipes, you just measure the diameter... but wings, plates, vortices...get complicated quickly.\n\n\nYou'll notice in the video I refrained from saying anything like \n\"Flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than XXX\" or \n\"Flow is turbulent when Reynolds number is more than XXX\".\nThere are different schools of thought on this.  Typically the transition between laminar flow and turbulent flow occurs somewhere between 2100 and 4000 (Reynolds number is unitless).\n\nLaminar Flow:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow\n\nReynolds Number:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number\n\nOsborne Reynolds\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Reynolds\n\nFeeling froggy?

Ultimately I decided it was ok to live with dye dripping out of the front.\n\nWe had to premix the dyes and eventually we got there.\n\nIt got to the point where we didn’t even really know what success looked like and always thought we were there.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe thought is my efforts making videos will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for my kids college education.

I think the most important technical issue to overcome is timing.  Much like how your brain can understand hearing someone's voice AFTER seeing their lips move, but not the opposite... the lag time of the sense of touch is an important thing for your brain.  Another thing I hand't considered is the \"rise time\" that has to do with internal stresses in your fingers.  If you conceptualize your fingers as water balloons around bones, you can understand how the internal pressure of your fingers rise the harder you press something.  This type of information coupled with the \"Sensory Homunculus\" make for some incredibly fulfilling thought experiments.  \n\nThe temperature question is something I'm particularly interested in.  Using a colder fluid to model a room temperature fluid because of the heat transfer equation is a fascinating area of scientific problem solving.  If you think it through, everything about this boils down to differential equations.  How much heat is leaking out of the hand, and at what rate, through what contact area?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nSensory / Cortical Homunculus \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus\n\nTwo Point Threshold\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_discrimination\n\nI asked HaptX for a blurb to explain their company.

A major mission of Hudson Alpha is to educate the public and promote genomics literacy.  I talked to many scientists about Genotyping but Dr. Lamb's ability to break down the complexity of the human genome is what finally brought it home for me.  Hudson Alpha provides many opportunities for Genomics Education and \n Hudson Alpha is http://hudsonalpha.org/ for explaining the difference between Genotyping and Sequencing.  To contact a super smart Genomics Professional at Hudson Alpha click here: hudsonalpha.org/contact \n\nGenotyping and Sequencing are very different:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing#DNA_sequencing\n\nThe 23andMe Genotyping service is provided by LabCorp\nAccording to their website, LabCorp is \"The World's Leading Health Care Diagnostics Company\"\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/\n\nNo Private or Health Information about any individual was recorded or shared in the making of this video (This video is HIPAA compliant).\n\nA special thanks to the Lab Manager Amanda Douglas for being a complete science rock star and a great person to work with  I spoke with about a dozen LabCorp Employees who are under Amanda and every one said she was an absolute joy to work for.  I know my experience working with her great and I hope her boss reads this blurb I wrote down here in the video description and gives her a high five and a big fat bonus or something equally as awesome.\n\n23andMe provide Genotyping testing using an Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 format chip.

Why haven't we figured this out before?  Whenever I go to Africa and South America I always make sure to pack a ridiculous amount of batteries.  People always ask me for them because batteries which you purchase in country are horrible.  This blending of an ancient technology with a new technology is a game changer, and as a mechanical engineer, I find it to be super exciting.  \n\nFor those wondering, the units are just under $10, so the payback for a family in a developing nation should end up being about 3 months.  This effectively eliminates the kerosene lighting poverty trap that millions of people fall into.

Couldn't have done it without Bob!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\nA quick clarification....\nIt took me 8 months to learn how to do this, but I was only picking up the bike and running to the end of the driveway and back every day.  I wasn't \"ACTIVELY\" trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.\n\nDo not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.  That's simply not true.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTweet ideas to me\nhttps://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nI'm also on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit\nhttp://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/smartereveryday\n\nIf you like what I do and want to support my efforts to create Smart kids and Smarter Every Day here are a couple of links you can use to help.

Ask her the results: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride \nTweet→http://bit.ly/CologneTwT   Post to FB→http://bit.ly/CologneFB\nhttp://www.harrys.com Promo Code: \"SMARTER\"\n⇊⇊ Click below for more info ⇊⇊\n\nIf you'd like to ask my wife what she thought about this experiment feel free to tweet her: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride\n\nIf you did what I do, there's a cool way you can make it easier for me to do it:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWill Leahy compiled all the data.\nhttp://willleahy.info\nIf you want to play with the graph, it's here!\nhttp://willleahy.info/SEDcologne/\n\nOutro music by A Shell in the Pit\n\"Bottles\" which can be downloaded here.\nhttps://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/minke-bottles\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nMy first attempts with a new cologne would be to just apply it and wait for a comment.  We have busy lives so often she wouldn't say anything.  If one reached out and grabbed her attention (I try to apply only enough for her to smell me when she's close... not like a high school boy who pours it on) I knew it was an interesting scent to her.  I tried to be honest, so many times I would wear one an entire day without a single comment from her.  That was pretty hard to do because I was hungry for data.  Sometimes if the mood was right and we were getting ready or something I'd casually ask what she thought about a certain fragrance.  She's conducted serious biological research projects before so she understood all along the importance of the data set.\n\nSome colognes I only tried once because it was obvious one of us hated it.  Others were kind of in the \"whatever\" region.  Those I would often try multiple times.  Some she really liked one day, but not another.  Those took multiple tries to weed out.  \n\nOften I would go without wearing anything, or perhaps my old aftershave just to make sure she wasn't gaming the system.  The first or second day or so I realized that if she knew the names of the colognes it DRASTICALLY influenced her opinions.  That just goes to show you how powerful marketing is on our perceptions. \n\nAt some points she got confused because she couldn't tell if I was re-wearing something I had tried earlier.  For example, she became a bit self conscious about whether or not she had already told me she liked one...   I could tell she was trying to give me consistent answers, but I kept shifting it up so much I filtered out all her attempts to game the data.  \n\nI also noticed that if I wore one that she complimented or mentioned without being prompted.\n\nIn the end, I'm really happy with what we chose.  It's light and a bit sweet, but still has swagger to it.  I fancy myself a manly man, and I think she likes that about me.  If you want to try to pull the answer out of her, I'm sure she would get a kick out of that. Tweet her at https://twitter.com/DestinsBride and see if you can talk her out of the answer.  If you're a normal supporter, PM me on Patreon and I'll tell you the result.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is the Facebook Survey I pulled the data from:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay/posts/808737802493720\n\nTweet ideas to me\nhttps://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nI'm also on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit\nhttp://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/smartereveryday\n\nIf you like what I do and want to support my efforts to create Smart kids and Smarter Every Day here are a couple of links you can use to help.

The possibility exists that I put the support positions too close together, which would make the values lower.  The players however gave us the sticks because they were \"so used they were now flimsy\".  Our data reflected this.  If I had it to do over again I would test a new stick vs an old stick.  Kettering University has done some research on this subject and we tried to setup our test apparatus similar to theirs.  They applied the force to the foot of the stick.  We applied the force to the center. http://www.kettering.edu/news/taking-stick-check\n\nI thought this was a great video of a product that has normalized the process by constraining the 1 inch deflection measurement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2f7SQgn-9I\n\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSUPPORT\n\nThis episode graciously supported by several people via Subbable and Patreon.

Instead, it only partially surrounds it, likely enabling better airflow to control for humidity and may help prevent fungi from growing on, and eventually killing, the pupa.

They require lots of time, and lots of favors from very smart and kind people willing to help me and you learn.  PLEASE take a moment and read the following information and support those who supported me.\n\nThis is the camera we used for the ultra-high speed shots.  It has the \"FAST\" option.\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/v16102/\n\nYou absolutely have to check out the stuff Cal Makes.  We're just goofing off in this video, but the guy is some type of glass wizard genius.  It would make me happy if you bought something from him and he felt like the audience appreciated all the time he donated to this video. He basically gave me 2 entire nights of his entire shop.\nhttp://orbixhotglass.com/\nI feel like we're friends at this point, and he is open to the idea of doing more videos in the future and teach me more about what he knows about glass.  Let's make it worth his time.\n\nI'm a HUGE FAN of the song Gordon wrote for this video.  His landlord would really appreciated if you downloaded it so he could make rent this month.\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/manta\nIt looks like he's assembling a new album that I may like more than Mammals:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/album/hydrophile-in-progress\nShow him some love.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis video involved about 2 months of research, and me reaching out to several individuals.  I would like to thank everyone who took time out of their schedule to contribute to my wacky research.  A big thanks to the following people:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMy wife and kids.  I'm sorry this took so long and I wasn't the kind of active father I want to be during the 5 weeks it took to make this.\n\nDr. Martyn Poliakoff for getting me access to documents which details experiments on the Prince Rupert's Drop by the Royal Society \nhttp://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/41/1/1.full.pdf+html  (behind a pay wall)\n\nBeing able to calculate the failure front velocity of a Prince Rupert's drop is a pretty big deal.  For years this was a scientific mystery.  High speed camera technology is only recently fast enough to provide data like this.  Thanks to Vision Research for letting me use the V1610 to try to unravel this mystery for the public in general. \n\nRob Kuefner for reaching out to me and offering to convert certain equations into LaTeX format for me.\n\nDr. Jeff Evans from UAH.  A friend and neighbor who just happens to have a PhD and be an expert in fracture mechanics. http://bit.ly/YLezDA Thank you for helping me by pointing me in the right direction in the early stages of my research.  It's time we hangout again.\n\nBrian: thanks for letting me use your green screen and telling me about Orbix in the first place.  I stayed up there til about 1 or 2 am two nights in a row acting stupid in front of of the camera all alone.  Now that I look back at that footage without the context of this video, it's all very strange.\n\nThanks to Loïc Samuel for taking time to make the custom TNT Degradation graphic!\n\nP.S. There was some old guy walking around the track at the park when I was filming me jumping on the bridge railing.  I'm pretty sure you kept walking until I was done just to make sure you wouldn't have to take me to the hospital if I broke my leg.  I'll never meet you again, but I'm grateful for this kind gesture you didn't know I noticed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterYouTube\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

Next I'll explain how the physics involved in flipping cats allow us to operate Space Telescopes (Seriously).\nSo as simple of a question as this is, it turns out to be a MAJOR POINT OF STUDY in Physics, Robotics, Space Satellite Control, Weapons Development, Biomedical Engineering, etc.  It's stumped scientists and engineers since Newton's day.  Here's something interesting.  The cat isn't twisting his back.. he's actually BENDING it.  The next video will go into great detail about what's going on there, and explain how it relates to studying the farthest points in the universe (Seriously... the fact that a cat can do this allows us to study the Universe.. no exaggeration).\n\nThe high speed camera used was a Phantom Miro M320S.

Your heart's plumbing SIGNIFICANTLY changed with your first breath.  AWESOME huh?\nHave you ever heard of someone \"with a hole in their heart\".  The Foramen Ovale doesn't seal completely causing improper flow.\n\nHere's the verse at the end of the video: http://bit.ly/xSFYDM\n\nMany people seem to be having a problem with Doc's explanation.  I would remind you that he's a Doctor and is qualified to make these statements.  We made that cut several times, and I asked him to simplify his summary very greatly.  When doing so he didn't include descriptions of meconium, pulmonary pressure differentials, etc.  These were discussed in detail, but I chose to leave them out and only focus on the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosis.   We also used the term \"breathe\" loosely when the baby is inside the womb because there isn't an oxygen exchange in the baby's lungs with amniotic fluid.  \n\nBabies do \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" amniotic fluid:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid#Functions_of_amniotic_fluid\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-88-470-1402-2_5?LI=true\n\nBabies do defecate in the womb:\nhttp://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(02)71437-3/abstract\n\nA special thanks to Wayne for filming the scene with Dr. Schuster and operating camera focus on the scene with engineering paper.\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

They had no idea what a rocket was. Happy Principal at 2:42 on the far left.\nThe Gambia is the smallest country on the African Mainland.  We went to a basic school and \"performed an experiment\" to measure the winds up in the sky.  The teachers, children, and the principal loved it.\n\nThe location of the school was deep into the heart of The Gambia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farafenni\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~MUSIC!~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe custom music was created by \"A Shell In The Pit\".\nThe song used is \"Rockets\" by \"A Shell In The Pit\".  Download it here:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/rockets\n\n\nStevo was living in The Gambia while he served in the US Peace Corps.  No laws were broken to get the Rockets to the School.  I mailed them months in advance LEGALLY. They were in a book because the Gambian postal workers have a nasty habit of stealing things they want. Books are pretty good camouflage! \n\nWe couldn't motivate kids to come out and watch, so we shot the first rocket for a small group of kids.  After hearing the rocket and all their friends screaming and laughing they came running.  The principal then instructed me to give an impromptu lesson on what rockets are, and why they are used to the whole school.  While I gave the lesson, Stevo taught all the teachers how to reload and fire the rockets.  In all, we did three shots and left the materials with the teachers for another day.  The science teacher in particular was so excited he couldn't stop thanking us.  He said getting the kids motivated about science education was difficult for him because of how many real world hardships the kids had.  The Rockets being launched at the school was the talk of the town for several days.  Kids who didn't show up to school that day were sad they had skipped.  Many more showed up after that, which was part of the goal.... to get people excited about education in general.\n\nHere is another video of someone else teaching well recieved STEM materials in The Gambia.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwsHbbTOpwA\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

That will be fun.\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/  -  Click for high speed video awesomeness\n\nAWESOME MUSIC INFO:\n\"Rep By Pop\" Written and recorded by James Cleary and A Shell in the Pit with bass by Neil Towers.   You can get the song here:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/02-rep-by-pop\n\nSeveral before/after experiments have been performed, but they all have one flaw. It's extremely difficult to visualize what is going on with the flow-fields of the weapon blasts during the time of firing.\n\nWe planned and assembled several different assets including a high speed camera over a few months and then ran a test designed specifically to allow the viewer to observe the gas dynamics in great detail!\n\nNeedless to say, this was a blast.  Well, two blasts if you want to be technical about it (and we usually do).\n\n\nI performed an experiment to see what the differences were between semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.  The advantage of shooting under water is that you can see the boundary of the gas flow fields almost perfectly.\n\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

He had taken time to educate himself on the law and his rights.  Its not a good idea to ever contradict a police officer unless you're 100% sure it's safe, and the officer is acting illegally.  Chris's incident seems quite the opposite of an interaction I had with the police in Tuscaloosa immediately after the Tornadoes.  The police force in Tuscaloosa went out of their way to make the public aware of their rights, and how to feel comfortable at night without any power. \n\nWe're not gun crazy people down here in Alabama.  We view guns as a tool, much like a camera or a vehicle.  These particular police men had run a suspected looter off from my sister's house the night before.  This is a great example of a government of \"we the people\" working for the people.  As much heat as policemen get these days on the internet, I thought it would be a great idea to give credit to these fine men serving us in harms way every day. \n\nThe Saiga 12 is a little difficult to load with the bolt forward.  Here, an officer shows me the right way to do it before going back out on patrol.",

        "description": "I thought I would upload some footage to let you know what it was like just after the Tornado hit.  We called it the \"zombie apocalypse\".  I had many very very interesting experiences during this time.  All of the 3 cities I have lived in over the last 10 years were affected in a major way.  My immediate and extended family were spared, experiencing only inconvenience.  The question is often asked, \"why would a good God allow such things to happen?\"  As a Christian, the honest answer is \"I don't know\".  I can however, report on how it changed us.  We met and became very close to very many people we otherwise wouldn't have known.  We were knocked off our high horse and forced to accept the generosity of others in thankful humility.  I feel like this disaster has made me, personally a different person, (and one might argue for the better).  \r\n\r\nTo say \"God didn't allow this\" is a cop-out.  He's either all knowing and all powerful, or he isn't.  I happen to personally believe he is both, and every life affected was changed in a very specific way.  I, like many others, began to focus on things other than myself and my own personal desires.  I began to try more earnestly to understand Jesus's teachings about how I'm to interact with others.\r\n\r\nWe feel really blessed to still have Briley after this.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  This is probably the only video about the tornado that I'll describe my beliefs on.  You will now return to your normally scheduled \"Smarter Every Day\".",

In actuality, what they've witnessed is a type of explosion called a \"Deflagration\". Many things are deflagrations.  Logs burning in a fireplace are Deflagrating.  The primer inside the shotgun is actually detonating.  Lead Styphenate or Mercury Fulmanide are used in cartridge primers to start the pyrotechnic train in a bullet/shell.  The primer itself is detonating, which kicks off the gunpowder which burns in the shell.  Any powder detonations occur in the chamber.  As the powder burns and begins to push the projectile out (gas seals with the barrel with something called an \"obteration seal\").  The powder in the barrel is also deflagrating.",

My favorite part is when she lets me put the chicken on her head and acts as if everything is perfectly normal.  I'm trying to teach her the concept of \"performing  a test\".  She's getting is pretty well.  We're starting to test matchbox cars to see which is the fastest and things like that.  \n\nif you are interested in helping us via a microscholarship (very micro) contact me for more info.\n\nAlso, after seeing my \"design\" another user, Jeremiahjw was inspired to create his own chicken steadicam.

Turns out, after we got all our fixturing dialed in, we were able to light multiple matches with a single bullet.  A phantom high speed camera helps tell the story.  Mythbusters only tried to light one match with a bullet, so we figured we might as well try to push the envelope.  I'm sure Jamie and Adam have the budget and time to figure out the perfect curve to stack arrange all the bullets in to light all matches.  They're good like that!  Heck, give us a little credit.  We're rednecks.  We're lucky we can even read.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

It's a combination of stopmotion and green screen chroma keying.\r\n\r\nThe video was created with the use of a home-made green screen in my garage,  Stop Motion software called i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, Garage Band, an Ipod and a talented Sister.  \r\n\r\nShe plays Acoustic Guitar, Djembe, percussion eggs, and a Mossberg Shotgun.  \r\n\r\nMeine Schwester spielt eine Coverversion des Liedes \"Brand New Key\" von Melanie Safka (aus den 70er Jahren).\r\n\r\nDie gesamte Musik (2x Gitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier, Schrotflinte und Gesang) wurde von Briley in einzelnen Videos gespielt und dann zusammen geschnitten. Meine Lieblingsstelle ist die \"Mit-Fahrrad-durch-die-ganze-Welt\"-Szene im Hintergrund. Das ist eine Kombination von Stop-Motion- und Green-Screen-Aufnahmen im Chromakey-Verfahren.\r\n\r\nDas Video wurde erstellt mit der Benutzung eines selbstgebauten Green-Screens in meiner Garage, einer Stop-Motion-Software namens i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, einer Garagenband, einem Ipod und einer talentierten Schwester.\r\n\r\nSie spielt Akustikgitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier und eine Mossberg Schrotflinte.\r\n\r\nMa soeur reprend \"Brand New Key\" de Melanie Safka (des années 70).\r\n\r\nToute la partie musicale (guitare x2, djembe, oeufs, fusil, chant) a été enregistrée par Briley sur des pistes vidéo distinctes ensuite assemblées au montage. Mon passage favori est la scène de la bicylette \"partout dans le monde\" en arrière-plan. C'est une combinaison entre techniques de stop-motion et de chroma key fond vert.\r\n\r\nCette vidéo a été réalisée grâce à une toile verte maison tirée dans mon garage, aux logiciels i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express et Garage Band, un Ipod ainsi qu'à une soeur talentueuse.\r\n\r\nElle joue avec une guitare acoustique, un djembe, des oeufs percussion et un fusil Mossberg.\r\n\r\nFrench Translation courtesy of: PiPoCoeur \r\n\r\nLooking for translations of this description in all languages.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

          "description": "Gav and Dan are in the GE lab using nanotechnology to show you cool liquid physics at 2500fps. \nThe first experiment shows a superhydrophobic surface that GE has been working on. Surfaces like this can be useful in aviation and wind power to reduce ice build-up or for self-cleaning applications. The surface traps a layer of air using its nanoscopic structure, which prevents water from sticking.\nThe second experiment also demonstrates how the nanoscale differs from the macroscale, this time with iron filings. Iron filings at the macroscale can be easily distinguished from the liquid they are in. When reduced to the nanoscale, magnetic nanoparticles can behave like a liquid magnet. Gav and Dan demonstrate this by showing magnetic liquid flowing upwards against gravity towards a magnet.\n\nLinks to GE's videos:\nMEMS - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PSdWSY_3m4\nCold Spray - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AdKVTzfTc8\n\nFollow Gav on Twitter - https://twitter.com/gavinfree\nFollow Dan on Twitter - https://twitter.com/danielgruchy\n\nSuper Hydrophobic Surface and Magnetic Liquid - The Slow Mo Guys\nFilmed on a Phantom Flex at 2500fps",

        "description": "Gav and Dan are in the GE lab using nanotechnology to show you cool liquid physics at 2500fps. \nThe first experiment shows a superhydrophobic surface that GE has been working on. Surfaces like this can be useful in aviation and wind power to reduce ice build-up or for self-cleaning applications. The surface traps a layer of air using its nanoscopic structure, which prevents water from sticking.\nThe second experiment also demonstrates how the nanoscale differs from the macroscale, this time with iron filings. Iron filings at the macroscale can be easily distinguished from the liquid they are in. When reduced to the nanoscale, magnetic nanoparticles can behave like a liquid magnet. Gav and Dan demonstrate this by showing magnetic liquid flowing upwards against gravity towards a magnet.\n\nLinks to GE's videos:\nMEMS - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PSdWSY_3m4\nCold Spray - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AdKVTzfTc8\n\nFollow Gav on Twitter - https://twitter.com/gavinfree\nFollow Dan on Twitter - https://twitter.com/danielgruchy\n\nSuper Hydrophobic Surface and Magnetic Liquid - The Slow Mo Guys\nFilmed on a Phantom Flex at 2500fps",

          "description": "We started a crowd funding to make it possible to make more than one video every four weeks.\n\nhttp://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt\n\nPatreon is a monthly subscription service that you can use to support the online creators you like! \n\nKurzgesagt has gone through the roof in terms of views and subscriptions and it already is way to time intensive that we can properly take care of everything. \nThat's the reason why we still haven't proper subtitles (despite of so many of you guys offering to make them for us!), that's why our website is still a mess and we take weeks to reply to emails. And of course that we only make one video each month and never know when we will be finished.\n\nSo, to solve this hot mess, we are trying to make Kurzgesagt at least a viable \"part time job\" so we can use \"daytime\" to catch up with everything and make more stuff while not risking our livelihood.\n\nLots of you guys wrote us in the last few months and wanted to support us, well, now you can! If you don't want to or don't have the money to spare, no worries! \n\nKURZGESAGT WILL ALWAYS BE A SEMI MONTHLY THING THAT IS FREE FOR EVERYBODY!\n\nWe really appreciate everyone who helps us out and we officially give you moral absolution for using add block if you fund us.\n\nWe didn't start this whole operation to get rich but because it is our passion. And we continue it because it feels right and because of the feedback we get from all of you. It has been a lot of work and a lot of fun. \nThank you so much everybody. Words can not express how we feel about Kurzgesagt and the amazing people it attracted. Thank you for your attention. We are humbled and amazed by all of you.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q&tab=2",

And of course that we only make one video each month and never know when we will be finished.\n\nSo, to solve this hot mess, we are trying to make Kurzgesagt at least a viable \"part time job\" so we can use \"daytime\" to catch up with everything and make more stuff while not risking our livelihood.\n\nLots of you guys wrote us in the last few months and wanted to support us, well, now you can! If you don't want to or don't have the money to spare, no worries! \n\nKURZGESAGT WILL ALWAYS BE A SEMI MONTHLY THING THAT IS FREE FOR EVERYBODY!\n\nWe really appreciate everyone who helps us out and we officially give you moral absolution for using add block if you fund us.\n\nWe didn't start this whole operation to get rich but because it is our passion. And we continue it because it feels right and because of the feedback we get from all of you. It has been a lot of work and a lot of fun. \nThank you so much everybody.
